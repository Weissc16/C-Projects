# C++ and Unreal Engine Projects

<h2>C++</h2>
<p></p>
There are multiple files in this repository that showcase my abilities in C++.  Creating variables, objects and class are all part of what is represented in this repository, through Object Oriented Programming.
<p></p>
<h2>Unreal Engine</h2>
The final file in this repository is the demo game that I created representing my ability with Unreal Engine.  By creating my own level, a key to pick up and a door to unlock, I showcase that I am familiar with using objects in Unreal and creating unique experiences like interacting with the door or the key.
